Hi, my name is Eddie Lu and I'm a CS major and a Business Administration Minor. I transferred from CUNY Brooklyn College and I am from NYC. My favorite class at BU so far has been XC475, a practicum taught by Spark! where we work on a semester-long project and present it at the end of the semester to judges and alumni. I also love to play volleyball and cook.
